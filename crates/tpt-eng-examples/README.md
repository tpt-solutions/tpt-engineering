# tpt-eng-examples

End-to-end integration scenarios that compose the `tpt-eng-*` engineering
primitives the way a real physical-systems vertical would: build an
infrastructure topology, derive its network matrix, regulate a plant with a PID
controller sized from a fuel's heating value, condition the gappy telemetry that
feeds the controller, and run a structural check on the supporting structure.

Each scenario lives in its own module as a self-contained function plus a unit
test, so the crate doubles as executable documentation for "how do I use these
crates together?".

## Scenarios

- **Thermal loop** ([`thermal_loop`]) — build an infrastructure topology, derive
  its network matrix, regulate a heater with a PID controller sized from a fuel's
  heating value, condition the gappy telemetry that feeds the controller, and
  report the converged supply temperature and the largest remaining telemetry gap.
- **Mechanical design** ([`mechanical_design`]) — define a cross-section and
  material, roll up a dimensional tolerance stack-up, check measured points
  against a GD&T zone, and render the result as a calculation report.

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
tpt-eng-examples = "0.1"
```

## Quick start

```rust
use tpt_eng_examples::thermal_loop::run_thermal_loop;

let report = run_thermal_loop();
// The PID must converge the supply temperature onto the setpoint.
assert!((report.supply_temperature - report.setpoint).abs() < 0.5);
// Telemetry conditioning must have repaired the dropout (a 5 s gap).
assert!(report.max_gap_seconds < 6.0);
```

## Crate modules

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `thermal_loop` | `run_thermal_loop` and `ThermalLoopReport`. |
| `mechanical_design` | `run_mechanical_design`, `design_report`, `MechanicalDesignReport`. |
