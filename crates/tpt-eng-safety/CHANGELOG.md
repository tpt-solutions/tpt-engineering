## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New examples: `basic` (`Quantity`/`Limit` dimensional checks and application-class safety factors) and `pressure_vessel` (a full hoop-stress, wall-thickness, design-pressure, and fatigue check for a thin-walled pressure vessel).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Initial release of `tpt-eng-safety`: safety margins and limit-state evaluation, computing utilization, margins, and safety factors and producing a structured pass/fail report. Hosts the consolidated `utilization()` logic that `tpt-eng-standards` and `tpt-eng-structural` delegate to, with `Quantity` / `Dimension` dimensional tracking via `tpt-math-units`.
