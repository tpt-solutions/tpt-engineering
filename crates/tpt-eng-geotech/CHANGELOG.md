## [0.1.0] - 2026

### Added

- Mohr-Coulomb shear strength `τ_f = c + σ_n·tanφ` and factor of safety.
- Reduced modified Cam-Clay yield surface and void-ratio update (normal
  consolidation / swelling).
- Borehole stratigraphy (`SoilLayer`, `Borehole`) with
  `tpt_eng_materials::DataSource` provenance tracking.
- Shallow-foundation bearing capacity (`bearing_capacity`): Terzaghi and Meyerhof
  ultimate bearing capacity with shape/depth factors, net and allowable capacity.
- One-dimensional primary consolidation (`consolidation`): coefficient of
  consolidation, settlement, and time-rate (time factor ↔ degree of consolidation).
- Lateral earth pressure (`lateral_earth_pressure`): Rankine active/passive
  coefficients and resultants, and the Coulomb active coefficient.
- Atterberg limits and USCS classification (`atterberg`): plasticity index,
  liquidity index, consistency state, USCS fine-grained group, and soil activity.
