//! # tpt-eng-power-components
//!
//! Power-system component models built on the complex-arithmetic and per-unit
//! primitives of [`tpt_eng_electrical`]:
//!
//! * [`Transformer`] — two-winding equivalent circuit (series leakage
//!   impedance plus shunt magnetizing admittance) with secondary voltage,
//!   input impedance, no-load loss and voltage regulation.
//! * Generator models — shaft-to-terminal conversion
//!   ([`generator_electrical_power`]) and the induction-machine slip / rotor
//!   power split ([`induction_slip`], [`induction_mechanical_power`],
//!   [`induction_rotor_copper_loss`]).
//! * [`TransmissionLine`] — distributed-parameter line with surge impedance
//!   and the exact `ABCD` (two-port) parameters of the long-line model.
//!
//! ## Units
//!
//! All quantities are plain `f64` in SI units, or in per-unit (pu) when the
//! caller works on a [`PerUnitSystem`] base:
//!
//! * impedance in ohms (Ω), admittance in siemens (S),
//! * voltage in volts (V), current in amperes (A),
//! * real power in watts (W), reactive power in var,
//! * frequency in hertz (Hz), length in metres (m),
//! * rotational speed in revolutions per minute (rpm) — [`induction_slip`] is
//!   a ratio, so any consistent speed unit works,
//! * distributed line parameters are *per unit length*: Ω/m and S/m.
//!
//! Turns ratios, efficiencies and slips are dimensionless.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```
//! use tpt_eng_electrical::Complex;
//! use tpt_eng_power_components::{Transformer, TransmissionLine, induction_slip};
//!
//! // Ideal 10:1 step-down transformer feeding a 10 Ω resistive load.
//! let xfmr = Transformer::ideal(10.0);
//! let v_sec = xfmr.secondary_voltage(230.0, Complex::new(10.0, 0.0));
//! assert!((v_sec.re - 23.0).abs() < 1e-12 && v_sec.im.abs() < 1e-12);
//!
//! // A zero-length line is a pass-through two-port: A = D = 1, B = C = 0.
//! let line = TransmissionLine::new(Complex::new(1.0e-4, 4.0e-4), Complex::new(0.0, 3.0e-9));
//! let (a, b, c, d) = line.abc_parameters(0.0);
//! assert!((a.re - 1.0).abs() < 1e-12 && (d.re - 1.0).abs() < 1e-12);
//! assert!(b.magnitude() < 1e-12 && c.magnitude() < 1e-12);
//!
//! // A 4-pole 50 Hz induction machine turning at its synchronous speed.
//! assert!(induction_slip(1500.0, 1500.0).abs() < 1e-15);
