Applied engineering primitives for the [TPT Solutions](https://github.com/tpt-solutions)
physical-systems verticals.

Dual-licensed under [MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [Apache-2.0](LICENSE-APACHE).

> **Not yet published to [crates.io](https://crates.io).** These crates are

## Scope

A set of small, single-purpose `tpt-eng-*` crates providing reusable
engineering maths — fluid/gas properties, time-series conditioning,
infrastructure topology, controls, structural/mechanical analysis, and
geometry/CAD primitives — drawn out of the product verticals as
foundation-pillar building blocks rather than product-shaped packages. The
workspace has grown from the original 14-crate Phase-0 scope (see
`spec.txt`) to 29 crates as structural/mechanical and geometry/CAD domains
were added.

All crates are new implementations built from scratch (the spec's claimed
consolidation source `tpt-rust2` does not exist on this machine, and the
external vertical repos were not available for audit from this build
environment).

## Building

This workspace depends on the [`tpt-math`](https://github.com/tpt-solutions/tpt-math)
substrate (`tpt-math-units`, `tpt-math-numeric`, `tpt-math-linalg`, `tpt-math-stats`),
resolved as regular versioned dependencies from crates.io — no sibling checkout needed:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tpt-solutions/tpt-engineering.git
cd tpt-engineering
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

- **Edition:** `2024`.
- **MSRV:** none pinned (no `rust-version` in `[workspace.package]`). Build with a
  current stable toolchain; the toolchain version is fixed by
  `rust-toolchain.toml` via `rustup`.

The `tpt-eng-props-*` family is `no_std`; it builds for bare-metal targets
with the default features disabled.

## Quickstart

Add the crates you need (they re-export `tpt-math`'s `uom`-typed units):

```sh
cargo add tpt-eng-props tpt-eng-controls tpt-eng-structural
```

```rust
use tpt_eng_controls::{Pid, PidGains};

let mut pid = Pid::new(PidGains::new(2.0, 1.0, 0.0)).with_output_limit(1.0);
pid.set_setpoint(10.0);
let mut y = 0.0;
for _ in 0..1000 {
    let u = pid.update(y, 0.01);
    y += 0.01 * u; // first-order plant, τ = 1 s
}
assert!((y - 10.0).abs() < 0.5);
```

For a full, cross-crate worked example (topology → network matrix → controls →
time-series conditioning → structural check), see
[`tpt-eng-examples`](crates/tpt-eng-examples).

## Developer tooling

`cargo xtask` provides one-stop hygiene and scaffolding (`check`, `test`,
`doctest`, `doc`, `no-std-matrix`, `new-crate`). A root [`justfile`](justfile)
mirrors these for non-Cargo users.
